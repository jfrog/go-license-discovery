# go-license-discovery

The license discovery is a library and set of tools
that can analyze license text to determine what type of license it contains.
It searches for license texts in a file and compares them to an archive of known licenses

This library encapsulate logic from 2 best licenses detection libraries :

-  License Classifier  : https://github.com/google/licenseclassifier
-  go-license-detector : https://github.com/src-d/go-license-detector

In Addition this library uses :
 - checksum based cache to have better performance detection of licenses which already been met
 - analyzed pom file to detect licenses which presented in the pom as a comment

Example :
- Copy licenses.db file: 
```
copy licenses.db (located under matcher/licenses/licenses.db) file to <licenses folder>
```
- Init license matcher: 
```
matcher.InitLicenseMatcher(<licenses folder>)
```
- Match licenses txt file to a known spdx licenses.
```
matcher.MatchLicenseTxt(licenseTxt)
```
- Read License from pom file comments and match it to a known spdx licenses.
```
matcher.GetPomCommentLicense(pomFile)
```
